Description: package for high-throughput genome sequencing analysis
 HTSeq can be used to performing a number of common analysis tasks:
 .
   * Getting statistical summaries about the base-call quality scores to
     study the data quality.
   * Calculating a coverage vector and exporting it for visualization in
     a genome browser.
   * Reading in annotation data from a GFF file.
   * Assigning aligned reads from an RNA-Seq experiments to exons and
     genes.
